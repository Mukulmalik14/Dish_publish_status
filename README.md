Hi,

Just wanted to let you know that I have proccessed your JSON data without using the API from the backend. I have created the API using firebase but facing a bug. I could resolve the bug but due to less time I have used the JSON data in my file itself. The algorithm will be same if I have used the API from the backend.

I will get the data first from backend and if button is toggled then set the status to false and send the post req through API which results in updating the baackend in realtime.

Thanks!
